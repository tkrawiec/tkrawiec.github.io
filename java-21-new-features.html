        <h1>Java 21 New Features</h1>
        <p>
            Java 21 brings a host of new features and improvements to the Java programming language. In this article, we will explore some of the most significant additions.
        </p>
        <h2>Pattern Matching for Switch</h2>
        <p>
            Pattern matching for switch expressions and statements enhances the capability of the switch to work with patterns.
        </p>
        <h2>Records Enhancements</h2>
        <p>
            Java 21 introduces enhancements to records, making them even more powerful and flexible for creating immutable data classes.
        </p>
        <h2>Sealed Classes</h2>
        <p>
            Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them, providing more control over the inheritance hierarchy.
        </p>
        <h2>Foreign Function & Memory API</h2>
        <p>
            This API allows Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime, such as native libraries.
