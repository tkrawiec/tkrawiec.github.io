        <h1>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</h1>
        <p>
            Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes modeling software to match a domain according to input from domain experts. It was introduced by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software."
        </p>
        <h2>Core Concepts of DDD</h2>
        <p>
            DDD focuses on several core concepts, including entities, value objects, aggregates, services, repositories, and domain events.
        </p>
        <h2>Benefits of DDD</h2>
        <p>
            DDD helps manage complex software systems by aligning the software model closely with the business domain, improving communication between technical and domain experts, and making the system more adaptable to changes.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementing DDD</h2>
        <p>
            To implement DDD, identify the core domain, define the ubiquitous language, and structure the software around the domain model using strategic and tactical design patterns.
