        <h1>Understanding SOLID Principles</h1>
        <p>
            The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob.
        </p>
        <h2>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h2>
        <p>
            A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.
        </p>
        <h2>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h2>
        <p>
            Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to allow the behavior of a system to be extended without modifying its source code.
        </p>
        <h2>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h2>
        <p>
            Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that subclasses should fulfill the expectations of their base classes.
        </p>
        <h2>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h2>
        <p>
            Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle suggests that interfaces should be small and specific rather than large and general.
        </p>
        <h2>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h2>
        <p>
            High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This promotes the decoupling of software components.
