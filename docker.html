        <h1>Introduction to Docker</h1>
        <p>
            Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and provide a consistent environment for applications to run.

        <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
        <p>
            Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
        </p>
        <h2>Benefits of Docker</h2>
        <p>
            Docker offers numerous benefits, including consistency across multiple development, testing, and production environments, improved resource efficiency, and simplified configuration and scaling of applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started with Docker</h2>
        <p>
            To get started with Docker, install Docker Desktop, create a Dockerfile to define your application environment, and use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
