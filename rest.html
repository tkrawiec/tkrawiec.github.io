        <h1>Understanding REST</h1>
        <p>
            REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol, typically HTTP.
        </p>
        <h2>Principles of REST</h2>
        <p>
            RESTful systems adhere to six architectural constraints: client-server architecture, statelessness, cacheability, layered system, code on demand (optional), and uniform interface.
        </p>
        <h2>RESTful Web Services</h2>
        <p>
            RESTful web services use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources represented by URIs.
        </p>
        <h2>Benefits of REST</h2>
        <p>
            REST offers simplicity, scalability, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for designing APIs in web applications.
